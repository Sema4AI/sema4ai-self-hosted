# 01 · Agent GitOps

Version-control an agent in git and publish changes back to its workspace automatically.

> **Why this exists (vs [02-distribute-agent](../02-distribute-agent/)):** 01 keeps **one** agent in
> sync with **its own** workspace — `pull` it into git, edit, and `push` changes back to the *same*
> agent (update-in-place: `edit → patch → publish`). Reach for 02 instead when you want to send an
> agent *outward* to **other** workspaces.

## The loop

```
                    pull.py (once / scheduled)
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  live agent in workspace  ──export──►  git repo │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                                │ edit runbook / config, commit, push
                                                ▼
                    push.py (GitHub Action, on push)
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  git repo  ──reconcile──►  draft  ──publish──►  live │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Bootstrap** — `pull.py` exports the agent, unpacks it into a git-friendly tree, and writes
   `.sema4/target.yaml` recording which agent/workspace this repo maps to.
2. **Edit** — change `runbook.md` (or other config) in any editor, commit, push.
3. **Publish** — a GitHub Action runs `push.py`, which compares the repo against the live agent and
   reconciles the difference (`edit` → apply → optionally `publish`), as either a **draft** or an
   **immediately live** version.

## Two repos

- **This repo** holds the reusable tooling (`pull.py`, `push.py`) and the [`action.yml`](action.yml)
  composite action.
- **The agent repo** is the customer's version-controlled agent. [`sample-agent-repo/`](sample-agent-repo/)
  shows its shape, and [`workflow.example.yml`](workflow.example.yml) is the workflow it drops into
  `.github/workflows/`.

## What push.py applies today

| Edit | Result |
|------|--------|
| `runbook.md` | ✓ applied (`PATCH` runbook_text) |
| name / description | ✓ applied (`PATCH`) |
| everything else — model, agent settings, welcome message, document intelligence, MCP servers, SDMs, shared files | ✗ refused |

`push.py` only reconciles the fields the API can patch on an existing agent. Any other edit is detected
and the run is **refused with a clear message** rather than publishing a partially-applied version
(those fields otherwise only enter via create-import). Some of them — e.g. MCP server and SDM
attach/detach — do have API endpoints and could be reconciled in a future version; today they are
blocked.

## Draft vs live

`mode: draft` leaves the change staged on the agent for review in the UI; `mode: live` publishes a new
live version. The convention in `workflow.example.yml`: PRs deploy a draft, pushes to `master` go live.

## Run locally

Scripts run with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — dependencies are declared inline, nothing to
install. Set `SEMA4_BASE_URL` and `SEMA4_API_KEY` (or put them in `../../.env`).

The agent repo is its own persistent git repository (separate from this one) that you keep and push
to GitHub — pick a real directory for it, not a temp path.

```sh
# 1. bootstrap the agent repo from an existing agent
uv run pull.py --agent-id <id> --dest ~/agents/my-agent
( cd ~/agents/my-agent && git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm "import agent" )

# 2. edit runbook.md (or other config)

# 3. preview a real run (default mode is dryrun — no writes)
uv run push.py --repo ~/agents/my-agent
```

> For a quick throwaway tryout you can use a temp dir like `/tmp/my-agent` instead — just note macOS
> clears `/tmp`, so don't keep anything you care about there.

`push.py` compares the repo against the agent's actual current state (it exports the live agent to
diff), so any change is detected automatically — no flags required.

It has three modes via `--mode`:

- **`dryrun`** (default) — preview only; prints what would be applied (a unified diff for the runbook)
  and what is blocked, calling no write endpoints.
- **`draft`** — stages the change for review (the live version is untouched).
- **`live`** — applies the change and publishes a new live version. Running `--mode live` when a draft
  is already staged (e.g. from an earlier `--mode draft` run) publishes that pending draft even if the
  repo adds no new diff.

Changes that can't be applied in place yet (model, settings, welcome message, MCP servers, shared
files) are reported and a `draft`/`live` run is refused, so a partial version is never published.
Discard a test draft with the agent's `discard-draft` to return it to pristine.

Before doing anything, `push.py` runs a local pre-flight on the repo (valid `agent-spec.yaml` YAML,
required fields, referenced runbook/SDM/shared files present) and exits with a clear `✗ INVALID` message
if you've hand-edited it into a broken state — so the PR's dryrun check catches mistakes early.

```sh
uv run push.py --repo ~/agents/my-agent              # dryrun (default)
uv run push.py --repo ~/agents/my-agent --mode draft
```
